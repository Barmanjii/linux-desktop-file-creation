# linux-desktop-file-creation

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo helps you easily **create, update, or delete `.desktop` files** on your Linux system using a simple shell script. For a smooth and interactive experience, we use [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to quickly find and select filesâ€”making the process super cool and user-friendly!

## Features

- **Create** new `.desktop` files
- **Update** existing ones
- **Delete** unwanted `.desktop` files
- Fast file selection with `fzf` for better UI/UX

## Getting Started
1. **Clone this repo** to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have `fzf` installedâ€”either install it yourself, or just let the script handle it for you! ðŸ˜‰
3. If the script doesn't run, give it execute permission:
    ```sh
    chmod +x your-script.sh
    ```
4. Run the script and follow the prompts!
